Do you know?

There is a 99.9999999 % chance this is not going to work on your device, so do not waste your time on it.

This is purely for my personal purposes.

To make this work, you need a heavily modified custom kernel built with all the configs enabled for Docker and LXC.

Even with that, it still will not work if your kernel is old.

If your kernel is GKI 2 (5.10 or above), good luck. The chances of getting this to work are 99.9999999967 % impossible.
